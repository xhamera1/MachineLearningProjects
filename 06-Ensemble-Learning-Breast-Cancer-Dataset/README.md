# Lab 06: Ensemble Learning Methods

## Overview

This lab introduces ensemble learning techniques for classification using the Breast Cancer dataset. It covers the implementation and comparison of methods like Voting Classifiers, Bagging, Pasting, Random Forests, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, demonstrating how combining models can improve predictive accuracy and robustness over individual classifiers. Key steps include training various ensembles, evaluating their performance, and exploring techniques like feature sampling within ensembles.
