# Lab 09: Neural Networks with Keras

## Overview

This lab focuses on building, training, and evaluating neural networks for classification (Fashion MNIST dataset) and regression (California Housing dataset) using the Keras Sequential API.

Key aspects include:

* Building Keras Sequential models with appropriate layers (`Flatten`, `Dense`, `Normalization`).
* Implementing image classification on Fashion MNIST using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), including data preprocessing.
* Performing regression on California Housing, incorporating feature normalization and experimenting with different network architectures.
* Utilizing Keras Callbacks like `TensorBoard` for visualizing training progress and `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting.
* Saving trained models for later use.

The lab provides practical experience with the end-to-end Keras workflow for common machine learning tasks, emphasizing model definition, compilation, training with callbacks, and evaluation.
