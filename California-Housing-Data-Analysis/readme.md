# California Housing Data Analysis Lab

This laboratory exercise involved exploring the **California housing dataset**, focusing on data visualization, correlation analysis, and preprocessing. The project included loading housing data, creating various visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots, analyzing feature correlations with median house value, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn. Key outputs included correlation analysis, data visualization images, and serialized train/test datasets for further machine learning tasks.
