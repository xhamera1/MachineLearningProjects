# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of machine learning laboratory exercises exploring various techniques and datasets. Projects include:

1.  **California Housing Data Analysis:** Data visualization, correlation analysis, and preprocessing of housing dataset.
2.  **MNIST Digit Classification:** Binary and multi-class image classification using SGD.
3.  **Regression Techniques Comparison:** Exploring linear, KNN, and polynomial regression on synthetic data.
4.  **Support Vector Machines Lab:** Classification and regression using SVM techniques on breast cancer, iris, and synthetic datasets.
5.  **Decision Trees for Classification and Regression:** Implementation of decision tree algorithms on the breast cancer dataset for classification and on synthetic polynomial data for regression.
6.  **Ensemble Learning Methods:** Exploration and comparison of ensemble techniques (Voting Classifiers, Bagging, Pasting, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) for classification tasks, primarily using the breast cancer dataset.
7.  **Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN):** Clustered the MNIST dataset via K-Means and DBSCAN, focusing on Silhouette evaluation and distance-based eps parameter estimation.
8.  **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the Iris and Breast Cancer datasets, comparing results on original versus scaled data, aiming to preserve at least 90% of variance with the minimum number of dimensions.
9.  **Neural Networks with Keras:** Building, training, and visualizing neural networks using the Keras Sequential API for image classification (Fashion MNIST) and regression (California Housing), incorporating TensorBoard and early stopping.
10. **Hyperparameter Tuning for Neural Networks:** Explored the impact of hyperparameters (learning rate, number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, optimizer) on neural network performance for the California Housing dataset. Automated hyperparameter search was performed using scikit-learn with a scikeras wrapper (`RandomizedSearchCV`) and Keras Tuner.
11. **Image Analysis with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Utilized CNNs for image analysis on the `tf_flowers` dataset. This involved loading data with Tensorflow Datasets, preprocessing images, building a simple CNN, and implementing transfer learning with a pre-trained Xception model. 

Each lab focuses on different machine learning concepts, preprocessing techniques, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn and related libraries.
