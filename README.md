# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of machine learning laboratory exercises exploring various techniques and datasets. Projects include:

1. California Housing Data Analysis: Data visualization, correlation analysis, and preprocessing of housing dataset
2. MNIST Digit Classification: Binary and multi-class image classification using SGD
3. Regression Techniques Comparison: Exploring linear, KNN, and polynomial regression on synthetic data
4. Support Vector Machines Lab: Classification and regression using SVM techniques on breast cancer, iris, and synthetic datasets
    Each lab focuses on different machine learning concepts, preprocessing techniques, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn and related libraries.
