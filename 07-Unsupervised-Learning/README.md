# Lab 07: Unsupervised Clustering

## Overview

This lab introduces unsupervised learning techniques using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. It covers the implementation and evaluation of K-Means clustering, focusing on the Silhouette Score for selecting the number of clusters (`k`) and comparing the resulting clusters to the known digit labels via confusion matrix analysis. Additionally, it explores the density-based DBSCAN algorithm, including a heuristic approach for `eps` parameter estimation based on nearest neighbor distances and analyzing how the number of identified clusters varies with this parameter. Key steps involve applying these clustering methods, evaluating their performance on image data, and understanding parameter selection and sensitivity in unsupervised contexts.
